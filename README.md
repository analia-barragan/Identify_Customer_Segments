# Udacity Project: Identify Customer Segments
This is the third project of the Udacity **Intro to Machine Learning** Nanodegree.
# Description

In this project, real-life data for a mail-order sales company was provided. The goal was to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers
of this company's products so they could be targeted for a mailout campaign. 

To complete this project data for the general population and the customers was assessed, cleaned and converted into a usable form. Then using unsupervised learning techniques, the data was
organized into clusters and these were used to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
